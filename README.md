# mTSP
This work was made during the course on metaheuristics at the federal university of s√£o paulo (UNIFESP).
It was focused on learning to develop several metaheuristics to solve the multiple traveling salesman problem.

## How to run it?
- All instances available are in the folder "all_instances". Put the instances that you would like to run in the folder "running_instances".
- Running the script as follows: python3 main.py rounds(int) export_results_option(bin) print_rounds(bin) print_solution_option(bin) print_routes_option(bin) print_execution(bin) plot_solution_option(bin)

    - rounds(int): Indicates how many times the algorithm will be run.
    - export_results_option(bin): During execution, a csv file will be mounted with the results:
    - print_rounds(bin): During execution will be printed a header indicating which round and which instance is running:
    - print_solution_option(bin): By the end of the execution, the best fo will be printed:
    - print_routes_option(bin): By the end of the execution, the best routes will be printed:
    - print_execution(bin):  During execution the partial results will be printed:
    - plot_solution_option(bin): By the end of the execution a graph will be made indicating the best route:
